# 2-bit ALU Design and Simulation Using Logisim

This contains the design and simulation of a 2-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Logisim. The ALU is capable of performing basic logical operations.

## Overview

A 2-bit ALU can perform several fundamental operations on two 2-bit inputs. The operations include basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).

## Features

- **Logical Operations**: AND, OR, NOT
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction
- **Logisim Simulation**: Visual representation and simulation using Logisim

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Logisim**: Ensure you have Logisim installed. Download from [Logisim's official website](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

### Running the Simulation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd Design-and-Simulate-2-bit-ALU-using-Logisim
   ```

2. **Open Logisim:**
   - Launch Logisim.
   - Open the `2 Bit ALU.circ` file included in this repository.

3. **Simulate:**
   - Use the input pins to provide the 2-bit inputs.
   - Select the operation to perform using the control inputs.
   - Observe the output on the designated output pins.
